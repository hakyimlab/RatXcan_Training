## Summary of RatXcan Pipeline:

1. Train PredictDB models for each rat tissue
2. Run PrediXcan on rat genotypes
3. Predict rat traits with PTRS
4. Compare PTRS performance in rats and humans
5. [Estimate heritability and sparsity of rat genes with GEMMA (BSLMM)](https://sabrina-mi.github.io/RatXcan_Training/GEMMA_BSLMM.html)
